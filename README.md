### From Source

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/KartikLabhshetwar/better-shot.git
cd better-shot

### Required Permissions

On first launch, macOS will request **Screen Recording** permission:

4. **Edit** - Add backgrounds, effects, blur, shadows, and adjust border radius
5. **Annotate** - Use the annotation toolbar to add shapes, arrows, text, and numbered labels
6. **Customize** - Select any annotation to adjust colors, opacity, borders, and other properties
7. **Export** - Press `⌘S` to save or `⌘⇧C` to copy to clipboard

### Quick Workflow with Auto-apply

For faster workflows, enable **Auto-apply background** on the main screen:

1. Toggle on "Auto-apply background" on the main page
2. Set your preferred default background in Preferences
3. Capture a screenshot - it will automatically apply the background and save instantly
4. No editor needed - perfect for quick captures with consistent styling
